To enable FxCop analysis in Debug build:
1. Install FxCop 1.36. It is part of the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.
2. Copy the tools\fxcop.cmd.template to tools\fxcop.cmd, and set the FXCOPDIR variable to the location of FxCopCmd.exe.

To run the unit tests in Debug build:
1. Install NUnit 2.5.10. The tests will probably run with earlier versions, too, but it was not tested.
2. Copy the tools\nunit.cmd.template to tools\nunit.cmd, and set the NUNIT variable to the correct path of nunit-console.exe
